        # explanation about this file : 
        '''
        the app.py file is used to configure the app and its signals.
        in this case, the ready method is used to import the signals from the signals.py file.
        there we have the signals that are used to create a user profile when a user is created and etc. 
        
        
        signals.py module is not being used or accessed anywhere in your code. However, in this case, it's a false positive because Django does use the signals, but this usage is not directly visible in the code.
