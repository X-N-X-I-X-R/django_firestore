Tree Command to Display Only Directories on macOS
=================================================

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the `tree` command on macOS to display only the directories without showing the files contained within them.

Introduction
------------

The `tree` command is a useful utility that recursively lists the contents of directories in a tree-like format. In this guide, we will focus on using `tree` to display only the directory structure.

Installing the `tree` Command
-----------------------------

If `tree` is not already installed on your macOS system, you can install it using the Homebrew package manager. Follow these steps to install Homebrew and `tree`:

1. Install Homebrew if it is not already installed:

    .. code-block:: bash

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. Once Homebrew is installed, install the `tree` command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        brew install tree

Using the `tree` Command
------------------------

To display only the directories in the current directory and its subdirectories, use the `-d` option:

.. code-block:: bash

    tree -d

This command will display a tree-like structure of directories without showing any files.

Example
-------

Here is an example of how to use the `tree` command and the expected output:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tree -d
    .
    ├── dir1
    │   ├── subdir1
    │   └── subdir2
    ├── dir2
    │   └── subdir1
    └── dir3
        └── subdir1

Excluding File Count Information
--------------------------------

If you want to avoid showing the count of files in each directory, you can use the `-I` option with a wildcard to exclude files. However, since `-d` already excludes files, this step is typically unnecessary.

Additional Options
------------------

Here are some additional options you can use with the `tree` command to customize the output:

- `-L level`: Limit the depth of the directory tree displayed. Replace `level` with the number of directory levels you want to display.

    .. code-block:: bash

        tree -d -L 2

- `--noreport`: Omits the file and directory report at the end of the tree listing.

    .. code-block:: bash

        tree -d --noreport

Combining Options
-----------------

You can combine multiple options to tailor the output to your needs. For example, to display only the directories up to two levels deep and omit the report, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    tree -d -L 2 --noreport

Conclusion
----------

The `tree` command is a powerful tool for visualizing the directory structure of your file system. By using the `-d` option, you can focus on the directories alone, making it easier to understand the organization of your directories without the clutter of file listings.
